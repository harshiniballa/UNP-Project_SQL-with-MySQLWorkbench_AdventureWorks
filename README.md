# UNP-Project_SQL-with-MySQLWorkbench_AdventureWorks


Completed this project as part of my internship with the United Network of Professionals (UNP).

This SQL project involves querying a database, likely in a retail or sales context, to extract valuable insights. The queries cover a range of analyses, including total revenue by category and region, average order value, daily sales trends, product profitability, customer count, and territory-wise sales. These queries provide a comprehensive view of the business's performance, aiding in decision-making and strategic planning. The project was completed in three stages:

1.Creating an Adventure Works database

2.Transferring the data from the backup file to the Adventure Works database

3.Writing SQL Queries

Key Highlights:

1.For data integrity, primary key and foreign key connections have been implemented.

2.Data Extraction from Backup Database

3.Data consistency has been preserved during the transfer of information from the primary database to the backup.

4.Creating SQL queries to get information about the company

5.Transferring Data Back to the Original Database

6.Obtaining vital company information, including total customers, sales contributions from product subcategories, top items by profit, and sales by area.

7.Taken together, these procedures show how to handle databases, manipulate data, and run analytical queries to obtain helpful insights from the Adventure Works dataset.
